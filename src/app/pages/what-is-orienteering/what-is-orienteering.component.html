            What is Orienteering?</h1>
        Orienteering is an exciting outdoor adventure sport. It involves walking or running while navigating around a
        course using a detailed map
        and sometimes a compass.
        <p>
            The aim is to navigate in sequence between a set of control points, deciding on the best route to complete
            the course in the quickest time.
            It does not matter how young, old or fit you are, as you can run, walk or jog the course and progress at
            your own pace.
        </p>

        <p>
            Orienteering events are held anywhere from remote forest and countryside to urban parks and school
            playgrounds. Itâ€™s a great sport for
            runners, joggers and walkers who want to improve their navigation skills or for anyone who loves the
            outdoors.</p>

        <p>
            The basic equipment required for orienteering is simply a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing.
            Competitive orienteers usually use
            specialized equipment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A thumb compass, or protractor compass on a short wrist cord.</li>
            <li>A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions.</li>
            <li>A clear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptions.</li>
            <li><a href="http://orienteering.org" target="_blank">IOF</a> rules forbid the use of artificial aids that
                competitors can refer to during a race, so GPS and other electronic navigation devices
                are not used.</li>
        </ul>

            Where do I get a map from?</h1>
        <p>
            The map is provided as part of the event. Orienteering maps are specially drawn in great detail with
            standard IOF symbols.</p>
        <p>
            Typically drawn at a scale of 1:15 000 or 1:10 000, the map includes features like streams, trails, hills,
            depressions, rocks etc.</p>
